# Dolin-Segmentation-UNet

This study proposes a model for the automatic segmentation of dolins. Our model was applied in an area where many dolines are observed in the northwestern part of Sivas city, Turkey. The U-Net model with transfer learning methods was used for this task. A dataset consisting of 374 images was prepared using orthophoto images having a resolution of 0.3Ã—0.3 meter.

* creating image and mask data.
* creating patches
* deleting images not including doline pixels
* creating dataset (train, validation and test)
* segmentation (U-Net model)
* prediction
* creating .shp file (vector data)
